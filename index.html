        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a current undergraduate student in the ITM program of IIT.
          Born and raised in sweet home Chicago, Illinois.
        </p>

          <h3> Aside from being from Chicago, I have other interesting qualities as well </h3>

            I lived in Europe for a good few years. Specifically Serbia. Where I finished High
            School and got a degree in Mechatronics. I spent a great deal of time on my computer
            where I always enjoyed tinkering with it, expanding it, or doing whacky things with it
            just for fun. Thus my interest in ITM as a whole. I was able to retain and continue
            expanding on my English even while spending a lot of time in a non-English speaking
            country due to this and spending a lot of time playing video games online with friends.

          <h4>My time in Europe</h4>
          <p>
            I moved to Serbia around the age of 10. Where I lived to the end of highschool. I
            finished a Mechatronics degree, and because of which makes me a certified technician of
            Mechatronics. I took courses out of a variety of subjects relating to the discipline.
            Such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="defaultlist">
            <li>Electrical Engineering</li>
            <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
            <li>Hydraulics and Pneumonics</li>
            <li>Beginner Java Programming</li>
            <li>Control Systems</li>
            <li>Technical Drawing (By hand and CAD)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It was an extremely unique experience where I gained a lot of experience as well. Due to
            the fact I also assisted our head professor in a variety of tasks around the school.
            Such as helping setup the schools Wi-Fi network, prepare class materials prior to start
            of class, and work on the school websites database. It was these activities that made me
            realise I was more suited for ITM work, rather than engineering. It is also a field I
            have much more passion for.

          <h4>My interest in computers</h4>
          <p>
            My interest in computers started from a young age, from as far back as I can remember
            really. I would watch my dad work on repairing computers, tinkering with them, and using
            them for a variety of tasks. I was always fascinated with them, and that fascination
            grew to a passion to working on computers that persists to today. While growing up I
            always spent time on my parents computers where I would use them for a variety of
            things. Nothing too special. But as I got older I spent more time doing more difficult
            tasks. I self taught myself through the process of installing a variety of Linux
            distributions, designing scripts and small programs, and video editing. Along with
            spending a decent chunk of time gaming, as is the usual these days.
          </p>
          <h4>Video Editing</h4>
          <p>
            Video editing was always something more of a hobby of mine. At around 8 I recieved a
            digital camera, and I immediatly started recording random clips from my daily life and
            try to make them funny or entertaining. I have some of those little videos even uploaded
            to youtube on an account I can no longer access! Not my proudest moment...
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway. While I spent time gaming with my friends I would save 5 minute clips from
            random things that we found funny or mischief we would find ourselves in. After which I
            would then assemble said clips into compilation videos for me and my friends to watch
            and enjoy having some of our finest memories recorded and assembled into videos we can
            all look back on. They started simple, nothing more than just clips spliced together.
            But, as it went on I spent more time on the actual editing. Some examples of things I
            worked on would be:
          </p>
              <ul class="defaultlist">
              <li>Music in the background</li>
              <li>Easy to read subtitles</li>
              <li>A modern looking opening animation</li>
              <li>Clips flowing into each other for a more cohesive feel</li>
              <li>Better cuts</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            I constantly strive to improve my editing and these are just some things I worked on.My
            video editing has slowed down in recent years as I focus on other projects, but I do
            look forward to when I can go back to working on some new videos.

          <h4>My gaming experiences</h4>
          <p>
            My exposure to gaming also began at a very young age. Around the same time I would watch
            my father work on computers, I would also watch him play video games. Mostly Age of
            Empires II and World of Warcraft. I found World of Warcraft so interesting that I
            memorized the log-in information from watching my dad play and while he was not at his
            computer I would go to the game and make my own character which was an exact copy of his
            appearance wise and class wise. With one exception, I put in my own nickname. I've spent
            time gaming in my free time practically since then. I spent more and less time gaming as
            time went on, but it was always something I enjoyed. It led to me being exposed to a
            variety of people while growing up. It also helped me make some friends online. Due to
            the fact that my family moved a lot while I was younger and thus I never really kept the
            same friends for a long period of time. The interent helped me bridge this gap. I've
            played a lot of games since I was 4 years old, but some of my favorites to this day are:
          </p>
          <ul class="defaultlist">
            <li>World of Warcraft</li>
            <li>The Super Mario Bros. Series</li>
            <li>The Witcher</li>
            <li>Payday 2</li>
            <li>Red Dead Redemption</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Stardew Valley</li>
            <li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</li>
          </ul>

              Here we see me and my mates after finishing a raid after hours of working together in
              World of Warcraft.

          </figure>
          <p>
            I treasure all of these games for a variety of reasons. While I would definitely rank
            World of Warcraft as one of the most persistent games in my life. As it allowed me to
            connect to people for a long time in a way that other genres of games dont allow you to.
